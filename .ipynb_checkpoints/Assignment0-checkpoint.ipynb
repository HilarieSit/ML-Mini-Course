    "The concept of machine learning (ML) was developed in the 1950's, but only recently became accessible to the more general public with the advancement of computer hardware. ML is a subset of artificial intelligence and is defined as “the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed” (Stanford). There are three main types of machine learning algorithms - supervised learning (labeled data), unsupervised learning (unlabeled data) and reinforcement learning (motivated by rewards) algorithms. We will focus on supervised learning with artificial neural networks, a specific type of ML algorithm."

    "NumPy and matplotlib are python libraries used in scientific computing. NumPy allows us to easily perform mathematical operations on arrays and matrices while matplotlib provides plotting capabilites similar to MATLAB. You can install these packages individually or download the Anadacona distribution, which includes most of the starting packages for data scientists. You will also need to install OpenCV, which is used for reading, saving and displaying images, and the OS module, which allows us to interface with the computer's operating system. Let's begin by reviewing several commands and concepts that are applicable in building machine learning algorithms. Write your code in the blank coding cells below, and hit control + enter to run. If a concept is unclear, feel free to email me at hs764@cornell.edu!"
